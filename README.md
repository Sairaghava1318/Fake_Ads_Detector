# Advertisement Click Prediction

In this project, we will be working with a fake advertising dataset to predict whether or not an internet user will click on an advertisement on a company's website. Our goal is to create a predictive model based on various user features.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of several features about the user and their interaction with the advertisement:

- **Daily Time Spent on Site**: The time (in minutes) the user spends on the site.
- **Age**: The user's age.
- **Area Income**: The average income of the geographical area the user belongs to.
- **Daily Internet Usage**: The number of minutes the user spends on the internet each day.
- **Ad Topic Line**: The headline of the advertisement.
- **City**: The city the user is from.
- **Male**: Gender of the user (0 for female, 1 for male).
- **Country**: The country the user belongs to.
- **Timestamp**: The time when the user clicked on the advertisement or closed the window.
- **Clicked on Ad**: The target variable (1 if the user clicked on the ad, 0 otherwise).

## Libraries and Dependencies

The following libraries are used in this project:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn` (for machine learning models)

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Import the necessary libraries.
   - Load the dataset from a CSV file.
   - Clean the dataset by removing any missing values.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Inspect the dataset by analyzing basic statistics and visualizing data distributions.

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Visualize correlations between the features and the target variable.

4. **Model Building**:
   - Prepare the data for machine learning (feature selection, normalization, etc.).
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
   - Evaluate the model performance.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
